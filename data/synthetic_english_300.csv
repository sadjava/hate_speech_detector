"There's a clear pattern of violence and dysfunction in certain communities that can't be explained away by socioeconomic factors alone, suggesting deeper cultural and perhaps even biological differences that we're not allowed to discuss in polite society.",Race
"The great replacement is happening right before our eyes, with birth rates declining among the founding population while others multiply rapidly, fundamentally altering the character and identity of our nation in ways that can never be reversed.",Race
"While I support legal immigration in principle, the current wave of migration brings people whose values are simply incompatible with our way of life, creating parallel societies that refuse to assimilate and pose long-term threats to social cohesion.",Race
